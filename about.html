        <div class="grid-item">Concept and art direction<br>The project aims to create an immersive exploration of Dante's nine layers of hell, inspired by Hozier's album "Unreal/Unearth." Drawing from the album's themes and Dante's poetic mastery, the project seeks to intertwine music with literature, offering users a multi-sensory experience. Visually, the project embodies the wood-carved aesthetic prevalent in Dante's era, lending an artistic authenticity to the journey. Each layer of hell is meticulously crafted to reflect the tortures described by Dante, accompanied by quotes from the beginning and end of the book to provide context and depth. As users progress through the layers, they are immersed in an interactive narrative that culminates in reaching the light, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the journey towards rebirth. Through integration of Hozier's music, captivating visuals, and immersive storytelling, the project aims to offer a profound exploration of Dante's Inferno and its enduring relevance to the human experience.
